# 🛸 Alien Message Decoding & Encryption System
A Python project to decode mysterious alien messages using string length mapping, dictionaries, and alphabetical sorting.

### 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates communication between scientists on Earth and an alien civilization.
Aliens send encrypted messages based on the length of strings, which correspond to alphabet positions.
Scientists decode the messages using a custom dictionary and also send encrypted replies back using the same logic.
The project also handles gibberish message reconstruction, where letters are scrambled due to cosmic interference.
